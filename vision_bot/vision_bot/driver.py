#!/usr/bin/env python3

'''
> Purpose :
This Node is going to send velocity commands to our differential drive robot
commands structure contains :
- Linear  ( x,y,z )
- Angular ( x,y,z )

in our case we will only be utilizing
- linear  x
- angular z

> Usage :
You need to write below command in terminal where your pacakge is sourced
- ros2 run maze_bot driving_node

Note : Name of the node is actually name of executable file described in setup.py file of our package and not the name of python file

> Inputs:
This node is a Publisher only so input are giving

> Outputs:
This node publishes on topic "/cmd_vel" with a buffer size of 10 every half a second
You can manupilate the time of publishing through *time_period* variable

> Instructor Comments :
I wish , students make below changes into the code
- Use proper names for the class and node
- Add ROS2 logging functionality
- Callback functions should have proper name
- Add comments into functions
